Express SQL app for collecting sales leads.


Here is the link to the tutorial that this git repository is based on (https://youtu.be/G8uL0lFFoN0)

The main learning objective for this project was to get a better understanding of the behind the scenes code. He did a good job of going through it and explaining what each piece of code is doing. 

I didn't run into any troubles until I was quite a ways into the tutorial. The first issue was this getting to view the website on localhost:3000. In the tutorial he had deleted the layout.pug and didn't instruct you on deleting any of the "extend layout" on the views.
Another problem I had was with the authentication when siging in and was unable to resolve that part.
I did have a hard time understanding how to use Bootstrap and would definitely like to revisit to learn that useful tool.

This was definitely a very useful tutorial and helped me to understand dynamic websites a lot better. I am glad we went through this tutorial before getting into the twist project. The tutorials we've done do provide a nice reference for future projects.
